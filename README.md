## My process

Hello again!  üëã

This time, I had a much easier time using `grid`! 

I also gave it another try at Javascript coding for this project. I think it's pretty neat!

Even though it could be done in CSS, I thought it would be nice to practice doing it in JavaScript.
  
  ***Cool Stuff:*** I added some animations. Feel free to explore and find out what I did ! üòÅ

**A problem:**
I wasn't able to access the 1.png/2.png inside the images folder when coding the Javascript. That's why the images are outside the folder... üò•

**Some questions:**

-   How can I access images inside a folder in Javascript?
    
-   How can I improve my codes?

- Did you liked the cool stuff I added? What would you do differently?


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS custom properties

- Flexbox

- Javascript
